# Gerrymandering Visualization # 

This project allows the user to visualize a measure of gerrymandering, defaulting to the efficiency gap, as defined in Stephanopoulos and McGhee, "Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap", 2014.

It also allows the user to explore and modify the metric by updating the JavaScript function used to calculate the metric for each state.
